Definitions:

- aspect ratio: The ratio of an image's width to its height. The use of width divided by height is intended to match the definition of the CSS aspect-ratio property.
- rectangulation: A nested division of a rectangle into subrectangles. A rectangulation defines a single specific layout possibility for a collage of images. A rectangulation can be abstract (a template) or concrete (a layout for a specific set of images)
- template: An abstract rectangulation that describes the physical arrangement of a potential collage layout, but does not contain any information about specific images. Example: a template might indicate that a layout will have two columns, where the left column has a single image, and the right column has two images stacked one atop the other.
- selection: A small set of images (randomly) chosen for a collage.
- layout: a concrete rectangulation in which the images have been placed into a rectangulation.
- collage: The complete information required to render a specific set of images as a collage. A collage contains metadata such as a description and a date range covered by the images. The collage also includes a layout, each level of which is characterized by an aspect ratio.
